## 🌟 The Integral Vision

This is not just a habit tracker; it is a **Holon**. It treats your daily practices not as isolated tasks but as interconnected movements toward wholeness.

*   **AQAL Framework**: Organize your life into the four primary quadrants: Body (Behavioral), Mind (Intentional), Shadow (Cultural/Emotional), and Spirit (Social/Systemic).
*   **Transcend & Include**: Watch your modules "elevate" with a glowing aura as you complete them, signifying their integration into a higher order of being.
*   **Cosmic Mandala**: A central, living progress ring that visualizes your daily journey from fragmentation to unity.
*   **Integral Aesthetics**: A custom "Teal" design system utilizing deep glassmorphism, parallax gradients, and intuitive iconography.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Daily Holarchy**: A smart dashboard that renders only the specific practices scheduled for "today," reducing cognitive load.
*   **Architect Mode**: Fully customizable. Design your own modules, specific practices, and granular weekly schedules (e.g., *Yoga on Mon/Wed/Fri*).
*   **Evolutionary History**: Weekly visualizations of your practice consistency, complete with text-based export for offline journaling.
*   **Privacy First**: **100% Client-Side**. Your data lives in your browser's `Local Storage`. No clouds, no accounts, no surveillance.
*   **Responsive**: Fluid design that adapts from desktop "Command Centers" to mobile "Companion" views.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
